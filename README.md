# Recommendation-system-using-Python
This Netflix Recommendation System uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to analyze user preferences and movie metadata. It applies collaborative and content-based filtering to suggest personalized movies based on viewing history, ratings, and genres. Leveraging ML techniques, it enhances recommendation accuracy for a better user experience. 

## 📌 Overview  
This **Netflix Recommendation System** is built using **Python, machine learning, and data analysis** to provide personalized movie recommendations. It utilizes **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. The model ranks recommendations using an estimated score, ensuring that the most relevant movies appear first.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed the dataset.  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and patterns.  
- 🏆 **Recommendation Algorithms**: Used **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity** for content-based filtering and **KNN for collaborative filtering**.  
- 📌 **Ranked Predictions**: Sorted recommendations by estimated score for better results.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Content-Based & Collaborative Filtering)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

🔮 Future Enhancements
